[**n-o-d-e video on decentralization**](https://youtu.be/SrA7XTDCtok)

i had an idea for an anonymous peer to peer [small-world network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-world_network)

possible framworks: hypercore / dat / ipfs / libp2p

**planned features:**

onair - cryptocurrency based p2p
- you get crypto for storing and serving data
- you pay crypto for requesting data and using p2p-cloud storage
- nodes passively mine crypto (maybe up to a certain cap)
- monero or monero-like transactions
- CLI, PWA (& maybe TUI)
