*tl;dr:* this post documents the 

* [**rapwiz42 colaboratory notebook**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1C4_CBrSJcUfRopQxaQqlrnU9Ve5Xk33F?usp=sharing) and the 
* [**verse16 python package**](https://github.com/pelgo14/verse16) 

and outlines their inception and future.

## how it all came to be...
one evening in February 2020 my friends and i were buying drinks for the night, discussing possible use cases for ai. 
one of us came up with the idea to develop an artificial, ai-powered-rapper. we expanded on the concept and when we 
arrived at my apartment, we thought about of a full blown digital identity, developed and maintained by us, performing 
self-written rap songs. 

our first thoughts revolved around creating a kind of public figure with an online presence, a face and an animated
3d model performing rap songs, which it has written itself. we thought about an artificial artist who only publishes 
**computer generated, but always original content**. with an artificial voice, face and "*life*". the next day i got to 
work and over the next couple of months, i developed multiple prototypes for this artificial artist, which culminated 
in the creation of many prototypes, [**verse16**](https://github.com/pelgo14/verse16) and [**rapwiz42**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1C4_CBrSJcUfRopQxaQqlrnU9Ve5Xk33F?usp=sharing). 

we tried "static lyric generators" like [**Song Lyrics Generator**](https://www.song-lyrics-generator.org.uk/rap/) and they 
seem nice when you generate the first text, but the illusion fades after you generate further lyrics and realize,
that the text is almost the same every time, just with changing keywords. this approach is very limited and requires
keywords from the user to bring some dire needed variation to the lyrics. the next day i came across [**this towardsdatascience article**](https://towardsdatascience.com/arctic-monkeys-lyrics-generator-with-data-augmentation-b9b1f7989db0).
this lead me on a new path, into the world of natural language processing, especially natural language generation.
 
## "These silver-white unicorns were previously unknown to science." 
### - [GPT-2](https://openai.com/blog/better-language-models/)
i initially created prototypes for [**lyric generation**](https://github.com/topics/text-generation), 
**text to rap flow synthesis** (no previous research done), [**voice synthesis**](https://github.com/topics/voice-synthesis), 
and a small command line [**digital audio workstation**](https://github.com/topics/daw). after creating prototypes for
a few months, i realized i bit off a bit more than i can chew, for now. a long term goal of this whole collection of 
projects,cprototypes and thoughts could be a [**digital audio workstation supported by artificial intelligence**](https://pelgo14.github.io/ai-daw). 
maybe i will be working on this goal in my free time, maybe not, i go with the flow. for now however, (only) the 
lyric-generating part of the project is robust enough for other developers to use. 

## rapwiz42
[**rapwiz42**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1C4_CBrSJcUfRopQxaQqlrnU9Ve5Xk33F?usp=sharing) 
is a neural network (gpt-2) and lyric corpus based lyric generation system.

[**rapwiz42 colab notebook**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1C4_CBrSJcUfRopQxaQqlrnU9Ve5Xk33F?usp=sharing) 

first, given a list of names of artists, their lyrics are scraped from genius.com. 

```python
artists = ["aesop-rock", "mf-doom"] 

import lyricsgenius as genius

# scrape
api = genius.Genius(self.genius_key)
iter_artist = iter(self.artists)
for artist in iter_artist:
    artist_api = api.search_artist(artist)
    try:
        artist_api.save_lyrics(overwrite=True)
    except:
        logging.warn(f"Oops! Cant download: {artist}")
```

then a text corpus is created from the scraped lyrics, and the corpus is cleaned of any bad characters. 

```python
import fileinput
import re

def extract(self):
    ...
    pass

def clean_folder(self):
    ...
    pass

def clean_lyricdb(self):
    # [intro: eminem] <- needs to be removed
    for line in fileinput.input(r"lyricdb.txt", inplace=True):
        if not re.search(r"([^\w\d\s',<?>])", line):
            print(line, end="")
```

output:

```text

Searching for songs by aesop-rock...

Searching for songs by mf-doom...

Changing artist name to 'Aesop Rock'
Changing artist name to 'MF DOOM'
Song 1: "None Shall Pass"
Song 2: "Daylight"
Song 1: "Doomsday"
Song 2: "Beef Rapp"
...
Song 225: "Marble Cake"
Song 204: "#chessboxin"
Done. Found 226 songs.
Wrote `Lyrics_AesopRock.json`
Done. Found 204 songs.
Wrote `Lyrics_MFDOOM.json`
Wrote `lyricdb.txt`
```

then a gpt-2 model gets fine-tuned on the text corpus. 

```python
import gpt-2-simple as gpt2

steps = 1000

file_name = "lyricdb.txt"
gpt2.download_gpt2(model_name="345M")
sess = gpt2.start_tf_sess()

gpt2.finetune(sess,
              dataset=file_name,
              model_name='345M',
              steps=steps,
              restore_from='fresh',
              run_name='run1',
              print_every=25,
              sample_every=250,
              save_every=500,
              overwrite=True
              )
```

output:

then, with this gpt-2 model fine-tuned to rap flavour, rhyming lines in an "aabbaabb..." scheme are generated.

## future plans

list all planned functions with demonstration of where in development this is... maybe someone has some ideas (like for the voice)
