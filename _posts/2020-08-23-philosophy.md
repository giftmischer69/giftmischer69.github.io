  - flow is satisfying
  - you improve really fast, you are more productive, etc.
- getting into flow state
  - workspace design
  - readme based development https://tom.preston-werner.com/2010/08/23/readme-driven-development.html

  - time in flow, the flow based lifestyle of the mma guy

- when to take breaks
  - https://dev.to/karan/how-to-take-breaks-while-coding-2ccp
  - once in flow dont take a break until flow is broken
  - when flow breaks naturally over time (e.g. when all work in current "brain buffer" is done), then take a break
  - it is important what you do in your breaks

Not forcing productivity at all but designing your workspace to
guide your work towards a meaningful, fun to develop project

Sometimes I have a day of just thinking through concepts. And
you need to have these days to have an idea of what logically
comes next in the development and how you want to implement it.
That's why I also sometimes have days where I write 500 lines
of code in a few hours

If working on projects is fun, it feels good to pour energy into
a project, and more work is done at the end of the day
