## some inspirational heading
in the beginning of 2020 my friends and I came up with the idea 
to create an artificial rapper. we thought about ai modules 
generating and performing rap lyrics. in the last months we 
came one step closer to our goal, with [**verse16**](https://github.com/pelgo14/rapwiz42) 
and now, [**rapwiz**](https://pelgo14.github.io/2020/09/06/rapwiz42/).
you can read the full story in my [**post on verse16**](https://pelgo14.github.io/doc/2020/09/01/verse16/)

"static lyric generators" like [Song Lyrics Generator](https://www.song-lyrics-generator.org.uk/rap/)
seem nice when you generate the first text, but the illusion fades
after you generate further lyrics and realize, that the text is
almost the same every time, just with changing keywords. this approach
is very limited and requires keywords from the user to bring 
some dire needed variation to the lyrics. 

## some inspirational heading about text generation, maybe a quote
with recent developments in the field of natural language processing
and especially text generation with models like gpt-2, xlnet and ctrl  
...

explain like [towardsdatascience.com/arctic-monkeys-lyrics-generator](https://towardsdatascience.com/arctic-monkeys-lyrics-generator-with-data-augmentation-b9b1f7989db0)
