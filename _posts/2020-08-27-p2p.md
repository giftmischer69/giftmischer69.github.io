*tl; dr* onair will be an [anonymous peer to peer]() [small-world network](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Small-world_network)

possible framworks: hypercore / dat / ipfs / libp2p 

**planned features:**

onair - cryptocurrency based p2p
- you get crypto for storing and serving data
- you pay crypto for requesting data and using p2p-cloud storage
- nodes passively mine crypto (maybe up to a certain cap)
- monero or monero-like transactions
- CLI, PWA (& maybe TUI)
