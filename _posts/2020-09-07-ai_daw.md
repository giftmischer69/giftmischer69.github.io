- **current state of development:** 
  - the lyrics get generated with a method similar to [**rapwiz42**](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1M27YXWJhepd4rhsB2KwRKGXZTwZRNIvz)
  - the lyrics get read out line by line by [**tacotron**](https://github.com/NVIDIA/tacotron2)
  - the sentences get stretched to fit the beat, concatenated and merged with the beat with a daw powered by 
  [**sox**](https://sox.sourceforge.net/) / [**pysox**](https://pypi.org/project/pysox/) 
- **dream features**
  - procedural / ai-powered beat generation (midi and/or sample based)
  - a *better* rap voice with a good balance between understandability and rhythm.
  - preserving the *dialogue mode* where config is queried one setting at a time in a dialogue (do you want a? (y/N) > y) 
  - preserving the *batch mode* where you can specify a song.yaml config file  
  - adding a *tui and/or gui mode*
