one evening in February 2020 my friends and i were buying drinks for the night, discussing possible use cases for ai. 
one of us came up with the idea to develop an ai-rapper. we expanded on the concept and when we arrived at my apartment, 
we dreamed of a full blown digital identity, developed and maintained by us, performing self-written rap songs. 
this is the idea which sparked **verse16**.
over 6 months after that evening, i published my first package to pypi. 
first the idea was x then it shifted to y. after realizing i bit off too much i  just reduced the complexity and 
features, made another iteration / revision / prototype and boom it works nicely, was in my skill set and i have a 
published package now, yay!

list all planned functions with demonstration of where in development this is... maybe someone has some ideas (like for the voice)



this started a journey.... this journey culminated in a bachelor thesis on natural language processing 



inspired by medium or datascience article of gpt-2-simple or generate with artic monkeys etc.
