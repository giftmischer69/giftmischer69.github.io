*development in progress...*

these thoughts are about not forcing productivity at all but to design 
your workspace to guide your work towards a meaningful, fun to develop project.
this probably only works for stuff you actually want to do. 

## preface
sometimes i have a day of just thinking through concepts. you need to have these 
days to have an idea of what logically comes next in the development and how you 
want to implement it. if working on projects is fun, it feels good to pour energy 
into a project, and more work is done at the end of the day.

## what is flow?
a flow state is a state of highest concentration and total immersion in an 
activity. being in the flow state is satisfying, skills improve faster and 
more skill and/or productivity is displayed because of the high level of focus 
and immersion in the activity. 

> Happiness isnâ€™t pleasure. Happiness is flow: a state of optimal experience; 
> a state of joy, creativity and total involvement in which problems seem to
> disappear and there is an exhilarating feeling of self-transcendence and control.

> But flow isnâ€™t just something that happens to us, itâ€™s something we can engineer. 
> Something we can get better and better at, no matter what weâ€™re doing, who weâ€™re 
> with or what life throws our way.

## reaching flow state

it is harder to say no to eating a chocolate bar, when you have already
bought it. things that you see and things that are around you influence your 
thoughts and motivations. i have designed my workspace in a way, that i mostly
receive triggers for things i actually want to do, like working on side 
projects, making music or looking at interesting media. this consumption of 
media can be anything like looking at interesting github projects, watching
youtube videos or browsing the web. the important part is what you consume. if
you only watch entertainment with no educational value, you may find it to be
less effort, yet you gain nothing from the experience.   
> Passive activities like taking a bath or even watching TV usually do not elicit flow experiences as individuals have to actively do something to enter a flow state.

throughout my teenage years, i was fascinated by videos from [vsauce](https://www.youtube.com/user/Vsauce).
after watching his videos, each time I felt like I had learned something 
interesting. many people reach the flow state multiple times a day for varying
amounts of time. i sometimes reach it when consuming edutainment (education + 
entertainment), like watching a math related video from [3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCYO_jab_esuFRV4b17AJtAw) or 
reading an interesting article from [medium.com](https://medium.com). i **design**ed my **workspace**
in a way that **makes it easier to start PyCharm than League of Legends**. i don't
feel good after i spent 20h of my weekend on league, but when i spend this 
energy on a side project and make substantial progress, it feels good.

## focus

not only getting and working in the flow state is important, it is important 
to direct the high levels of productivity towards activities worth doing. at the
workplace this means working on projects in the right order based on priority, 
at home it could be anything you consider worth doing. personally i have decided
on a few prioritized activities and designed my workspace so i mostly receive
triggers for these activities, like the icons in the taskbar and on the desktop,
the bookmarks in my browser and also removed all video-games except one (its melee
for [phillip ai](https://github.com/vladfi1/phillip) and other reasons). for me it is important to have some
non-productive hours throughout the day too, to stay happy and contempt. 
still, i designed my life in a way that i do more stuff that i intrinsically want
to do, so i am more satisfied. my father used to say "the amount of bad habits
always remains the same". i think you can guide these in a way too, but i am also
still working on that ;). i also think you should listen to your gut on what feels
good and what gets you in the flow. this way you can maybe avoid a burnout or 
similar issues.

for software developers suffering-oriented-programming is a very good framework
to guide your energy and productivity towards important tasks. is involves rapid
prototyping and follows the mantra:
> "First make it possible. Then make it beautiful. Then make it fast."

> It's better to just "hack things out" and be very direct about solving
> the problems you have at hand. This allows you to get done what you need to get 
> done and avoid wasted work. As you're hacking things out, you'll learn more and 
> more about the intricacies of the problem space.

> "Don't build technology unless you feel the pain of not having it."

## habits
it is better to exercise once a day for one hour a day than once a week for three.
this can be applied to programming as well, to an extent.

## dangers of flow
when to take breaks?
- once in flow dont take a break until flow is broken
- when flow breaks naturally over time (e.g. when all work in current "brain buffer" is done), then take a break
- it is important what you do in your breaks

> "Being in the flow for long is unsustainable - the flow will end in a natural way
> at some point - and you should take a break at that point. And in this case, the
> break can be of any length - from 15 mins to a day or two.

> One of the downsides of the flow is that one tends to ignore physical signs. 
> Those are risky, being in touch with your body is crucial - especially while 
> coding since most of the time you are inside your head. As soon as there is a 
> physical feeling of sleepiness, discomfort, pain or exhaustion - you must take a 
> break. No ifs, buts or maybes. Pushing yourself beyond what is physically 
> tolerated by your body is a recipe for disaster in the long run.

> Electronic screens are also the main reason for sleep deprivation - we do not
> realize how much it affects our sleep - using flux/night shift helps alleviate
> a little - but it's never enough.

> The one thing which I strongly urge practising software engineers to do is 
> get away from their screens - for atleast couple of hours a day. Rest your
> eyes on something that is further than 10 meters for an extended period of time -
> you will realize how different it feels - just looking at something that
> is afar for an extended period of time."
